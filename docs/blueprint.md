## Core Features:

- Language Selection: User can select between English and Malayalam languages for input and output.
- Confusion Level Slider: A slider to allow the user to control the desired level of confusion in the response (Mild, Moderate, Maximum Nonsense).
- Input Method: User can either speak via microphone or input text. Speech input will be transcribed.
- Confused Response Generation: Leverage an AI tool that rewrites a sentence to be technically true but highly confusing using double negatives, vague qualifiers, and circular logic. AI is contrained to be truthful but avoid clarity.
- Text-to-Speech Playback: Robot voice playback of the 'confused' response (text-to-speech).
- Confused Response Display: Display the transformed 'confused' response in 1-2 awkward sentences, rendered on a dedicated results page.
- Session logging: User interactions can optionally be saved, if the user creates an account

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#A7D1AB), evokes a sense of something slightly off and unnatural. Based on user's teal/green color request, without being too literal or obvious.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the text.
- Accent color: Glitchy neon pink (#FF69B4), draws attention and creates a sense of digital malfunction.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for headlines, lending a broken legal document feel per the user request, paired with 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for the display of technical terms or code snippets.
- Expressive icons for buttons like voice input (üéôÔ∏è), confuse (üåÄ), and replay (üéß), with a nod to the robotic Pinocchio avatar.
- Micro-delays when processing user input to build anticipation, alongside a glitchy text fade-in for the 'confused' response and LED animation for voice output.
