# Obfuscate üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: codeStorm

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Goutham V E - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad
- Member 2: Rajath Raj K T - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad

### Project Description
A satirical web tool that transforms simple, clear sentences into ridiculously confusing, verbose, and evasive statements. It‚Äôs a machine built to say nothing, but in the most truthful and complicated way possible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world plagued by direct communication and clear answers, there is a severe shortage of tools for saying nothing at all. Humans are burdened by the need to be understood, a tragic flaw that we seek to rectify.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've engineered a sophisticated **"Confusion Engine"** that takes any straightforward input and rewrites it using double negatives, circular logic, and bureaucratic filler. It allows you to speak the truth, without ever being helpful. The nose-growing animation is a crucial feature, of course.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, Node.js, Genkit, Tailwind CSS
- **Libraries/Models:** React, googleai/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts (Algenib voice)
- **Tools & Services:** Git, GitHub, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Vercel

For Hardware:
- None (100% software project)
- Our only physical component is the collective sigh of misunderstood project managers.
