# Obfuscate

## Basic Details

### Team Name: codeStorm

### Team Members
- **Team Lead:** Goutham V E - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad
- **Member 2:** Rajath Raj K T - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad

### Project Description
A satirical web tool that transforms simple, clear sentences into ridiculously confusing, verbose, and evasive statements. It’s a machine built to say nothing, but in the most truthful and complicated way possible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world plagued by direct communication and clear answers, there is a severe shortage of tools for saying nothing at all. Humans are burdened by the need to be understood, a tragic flaw that we seek to rectify.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've engineered a sophisticated **"Confusion Engine"** that takes any straightforward input and rewrites it using double negatives, circular logic, and bureaucratic filler. It allows you to speak the truth, without ever being helpful. The nose-growing animation is a crucial feature, of course.

### Screenshots
1. **Main Interface**

2. **Before Transformation**  
<img width="1172" height="849" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ba6f983-c689-4297-97e9-97ef2ea1bd1d" />

This image shows a web interface with a light, minimalist theme. The title "Obfuscate" is prominently displayed with the tagline "Technically true, maximally confusing." Below it, a section titled "Start Confusing" prompts the user to enter a sentence. There are options for "Text Input" and "Voice Input." An example sentence, "e.g., The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," is provided. The interface allows the user to select a language (defaulting to English) and adjust the "Confusion: Moderate" level using a slider. The main action button is a light green color and says "Confuse Me." A small robot icon labeled "Thug Bot" is visible.

3. **After Transformation**

This image shows a light-themed user interface displaying a "Confused Response." The original text, "hello how about your study," is shown at the top. Below, a light green box contains the obfuscated or "confused" version of the sentence. The rewritten text is significantly more complex and convoluted, reading: "It wouldn't be inaccurate to suggest that my engagement with scholastic pursuits isn't entirely devoid of a certain quality, such that the absence of any progress cannot be definitively ascertained, if one were to disregard the potential for negligible increments which are neither here nor there." Below this response, there are three buttons for user actions: "Again," "Copy," and "Save." A small, light green robot icon is also visible in the top right corner.

This image displays a web interface that appears to be a dark-themed, alternative version of the first image. The title and tagline remain the same. The section title is changed to "Final Boss." The overall color scheme is dark, with highlights and text in red and white. The robot icon is also red. The action button is now a bright red circle with a "K.O" label and a stylized "power" symbol, suggesting a more aggressive or challenging mode compared to the first image. The "Confusion" level is still set to "Moderate," and the input fields and options are identical to the first image, but with a different visual style.


### Diagrams
![WhatsApp Image 2025-08-09 at 06 53 11_ed9b6b7c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c60c057e-8157-4b0e-98db-490bcd480803)

A user enters a sentence on the **Next.js frontend**.  
This triggers a **Genkit AI** flow on the **Node.js backend**.  
The flow interacts with the **Gemini model** to transform the text and generate speech.  
The resulting convoluted text and audio are sent back to the frontend to be displayed and played for the user, alongside the crucial nose animation.

**For Hardware:**  
As this is a software-only project, there are no hardware diagrams or builds. All construction was purely logical and tragically virtual.

## Project Demo

**Video:**  
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1uRJ2KGc2M4?si=_j2h3IlMQ0Cs82de)  
Watch in amazement as we feed Obfuscate a simple *"yes"* and receive a three-paragraph essay that somehow means *"maybe, but also no, unless it is."*  
The nose growth is, of course, synchronized perfectly.
